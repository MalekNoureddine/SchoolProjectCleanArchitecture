# School Management System API (Clean Architecture)
## üìö Overview
This project is a **School Management System API** built using **Clean Architecture** principles. It focuses on implementing best practices for a scalable and maintainable back-end solution. The system uses **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to separate read and write operations and employs MediatR for request handling.

## Key Features
- **Clean Architecture** with modular structure:
  - **Core**:
    - **Features** : Command and query Modles(requests) entities and responses entities, validation and Handlers for each entity.
    - **Mapper** : for mapping responses and requests to enitities.
    - **Behavior** : handles validation behaviors.
    - **Bases** : Contains geniric classes for Response handling.
    - **MiddleWares** : For handling Exeptions.
    - **SharedResources** : For translating.
    - **Wrapper** : conatains pagination logic.
  - **Service**: Application-level logic for handling commands and queries, contains business logic, and interfaces.
  - **Infrastructure**: Database context and entity configurations.
  - **Data**: Entities, Healpers, Enums , Requests and Responses.
  - **API**: Exposes endpoints for client interaction.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - **JWT**-based authentication.
  - **Role**-based access control.
- **Entity Relationships:**
  - Configured relationships (one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many) between entities such as Students, Instructors, Departments, and Subjects.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **CQRS**: Separation of commands and queries.
  - **MediatR** for endpoint request handling.
  - **Fluent Validation** for input validation.
  - **Mapping**: Object-to-object mapping for better abstraction.
- Focus on Scalability and maintainability.
- Implementing SOLID prencipals.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack**
  - **Backend:** C# with .NET 6
  - **ORM:** Entity Framework Core
  - **Authentication:** JWT with role-based access control
  - **Validation:** Fluent Validation
  - **MediatR:** For CQRS and request handling
  - **Database:** SQL Server
